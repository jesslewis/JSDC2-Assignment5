## Questions?

What questions do you have? What would like us to take a close look at when reviewing your HW?

1. I could not figure out how to connect with the MVC. Everything I did, did not pull through. I googled a lot but wasn't able to find a lot of helpful resources on this.  I also tried reading the Handlebars.js website and sadly was still not able to figure it out. 

2. I then tried just to do it in JS and JQuery.  I got the counter to go up! But then when I added in to go down or reset it stopped working... 

3. In my vanilla, which really isn't vanilla JS, JS attempt I wrote out what I was trying to do.  I still feel like I struggle getting started and how to know what to use when.  Function, varibale, loops, conditions, etc.... SORRY :/

I'll be at office hours for sure on Thursday and Sunday...
